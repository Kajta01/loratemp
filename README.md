# LoRaTemp

Arduino LoRaWan project for logging temperatures.

Code for reading temperatures from a [DS18B20 temperature sensor](documentation/DS18B20-Datasheet.pdf) was inspired by the [hobbytronics DS1820 Temperature Sensor](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/ds18b20-arduino) blog.

The LoRaWan part of this project will be based on the [MicroChip RN2483](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN2483) module. The [datasheet](documentation/RN2483-Datasheet.pdf) and [userguide](documentation/RN2483-Userguide.pdf) are stored in the documentation folder of this project, together with other interesting documents and links.
